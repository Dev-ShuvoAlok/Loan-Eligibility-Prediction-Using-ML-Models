# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Using-ML-Models
It is expected that the development of ML models that can help the company predict loan approval in accelerating decision-making process for determining whether an applicant is eligible for a loan or not.

# Objectives of Notebook
This notebook aims to:
- Analyze customer data provided in data set (EDA)
- Build various ML models that can predict loan approval

# The machine learning models used in this project are:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boost
